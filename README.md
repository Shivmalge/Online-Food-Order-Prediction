# Online-Food-Order-Prediction

## Introduction: 

###                           There has been a high demand for online food orders after the introduction of Swiggy and Zomato in the market. Food delivery companies use our buying habits to make the delivery process faster. The food order prediction system is one of the useful techniques these companies can use to make the entire delivery process fast. After implementing the complete online food delivery system, companies like Swiggy and Zomato will always try to improve them. The main objective of these companies toward their customers is to deliver the food at the right time. To deliver the food faster, these companies identify areas where the demand for online food orders is high and employ more delivery partners in those locations. It helps deliver food faster in areas with more orders.  
###                           These companies have so much data about their customers that they now know the food ordering habits of all customers. With this data, they can also predict whether or not a customer will order again from their app. It is a good technique for identifying areas, families and customer types with more business opportunities.
## So according to above problem statement, I have build the machine learning model which will predict the online food order from particular customers.

# Model:

### 1. Python Libraries used to build the model:
#### 1. Numpy 
#### 2. Pandas
#### 3. Matplotlib
#### 4. Seaborn
#### 5. Plotly

### 2. First of all I have read the dataset using pandas library and dataset contains the information like:
#### 1. the age of the customer
#### 2. marital status of the customer
#### 3. occupation of the customer
#### 4. monthly income of the customer
#### 4. educational qualification of the customer
#### 5. family size of the customer
#### 6. latitude and longitude of the location of the customer
#### 7. pin code of the residence of the customer
#### 8. did the customer order again (Output)
#### 9. Feedback of the last order (Positive or Negative)
